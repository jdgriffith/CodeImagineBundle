This project has a console command which will create classes from yaml files.

How to Use
----------

As of right now, you only have to run the following command:

```
app/console generate:class --file=Class.yml
```

This will effectively create all the classes and interfaces in your Yaml file. The example Class.yml file is included in this project.
